# The analysis
## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
The objective is to identify the most in-demand skills for the top three most popular data roles. I filtered out the positions based on their popularity and identified the top five skills for the top three roles. This query identifies the most common job titles and their top skills, indicating which skills should be prioritized based on the targeted role.

### Insights
- Key Takeaways by Role

    Data Analyst üìä: This role is heavily focused on retrieving and reporting data. SQL (51%) and Excel (41%) are the most requested skills, highlighting the need to query databases and present findings in a common business tool. Visualization skills, represented by Tableau (28%), are also significant.

    Data Engineer ‚öôÔ∏è: This role is all about building and maintaining data infrastructure. SQL (68%) and Python (65%) are nearly equally critical for creating data pipelines. The strong presence of cloud platforms like AWS (43%) and Azure (32%) clearly marks this as a technical, infrastructure-oriented position.

    Data Scientist üß™: This role is dominated by programming for statistical modeling and analysis. Python (72%) is the most in-demand skill by a large margin. While SQL (51%) is crucial for accessing data, statistical programming languages like R (44%) are also highly valued.

- Cross-Role Comparison

    SQL is the Universal Language: It is a top-two skill for all three roles, making it the most universally required skill in the data field.

    Python's Importance Varies: It is absolutely essential for Data Scientists and Data Engineers but is significantly less requested for Data Analysts.

    Specialized Tools Define the Job:

    The high demand for Excel is unique to the Data Analyst role.

    Expertise in cloud technologies (AWS, Azure) and Spark is a key differentiator for Data Engineers.

    A strong command of both Python and R is most characteristic of a Data Scientist.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data?
### Highest Paid & Most Demand Skills for Data Roles
#### Visualize Data (Key Codes)
```Python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assume df_DA_top_pay and df_DA_skills are pre-existing DataFrames
# df_DA_top_pay: DataFrame with index as skills, 'median' column for salary, sorted by highest paid
# df_DA_skills: DataFrame with index as skills, 'median' column for salary, sorted by most in-demand

# 1. Create a figure with two vertically stacked subplots
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 8)) 
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

# --- Plot 1: Highest Paid Skills ---
sns.barplot(
    data=df_DA_top_pay, 
    x='median', 
    y=df_DA_top_pay.index, 
    ax=ax[0], 
    palette='dark:b_r'
)
ax[0].set_title('Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts in the US')

# --- Plot 2: Most In-Demand Skills ---
sns.barplot(
    data=df_DA_skills, 
    x='median', 
    y=df_DA_skills.index, 
    ax=ax[1], 
    palette='light:b'
)
ax[1].set_title('Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')


# 2. Synchronize the x-axis for a fair comparison
# This makes sure both charts use the same salary scale.
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())

# 3. Format x-axis labels on both plots for readability (e.g., $150K)
formatter = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)

# Clean up layout and display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![The Highest Paid & Most In-demand Skills](images/Highest_Paid_and_Most_In_Demand_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_the_US.png)


#### Insights
- The Pay vs. Demand Paradox: The most significant insight is that there is no overlap between the top 10 highest-paid skills and the top 10 most in-demand skills. The skills that make you most hirable are not the ones that earn the most money.
- In-Demand Skills are Foundational: The most requested skills are the core tools of data analysis: programming languages (python, sql, r), BI software (tableau, power bi), and business tools (excel, powerpoint). These skills have median salaries clustered around $90K-$100K.
- High-Paying Skills are Specialized: The highest salaries are tied to specialized, technical skills often found in software engineering, MLOps, or blockchain, such as solidity (blockchain), hugging face (AI/ML), and gitlab (DevOps). These niche skills command salaries starting around $150K and reaching nearly $200K.

## 4. What's the optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts?

### Visualize Data (Key Codes)
```Python
# 1. Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
from adjustText import adjust_text # Required for label adjustment: pip install adjustText

# Assume df_DA_skills_high_demand is a pre-processed DataFrame.
# It must contain the following columns:
# 'skill_percent': The percentage of job postings that mention the skill.
# 'median_salary': The median salary associated with the skill.
# 'technology': The category the skill belongs to (for color-coding).
# The DataFrame's index should be the skill name (e.g., 'python', 'sql').

# --- 1. Create the base scatter plot, color-coded by technology ---
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_DA_skills_high_demand,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology',
    s=100 # Increase the size of the points for better visibility
)

# --- 2. Smartly adjust text labels to prevent them from overlapping ---
# Prepare the text labels for each point on the plot
texts = []
for i, skill_name in enumerate(df_DA_skills_high_demand.index):
    texts.append(
        plt.text(
            df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'].iloc[i], 
            df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'].iloc[i], 
            skill_name
        )
    )

# Use adjust_text to automatically position the labels
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))

# --- 3. Format the axes and chart titles for clarity ---
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Yearly Salary')
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.legend(title='Technology')

# Get the current axes object for advanced formatting
ax = plt.gca()
# Format the y-axis to show dollars in thousands (e.g., $100K)
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))
# Format the x-axis as percentages (e.g., 20%)
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(xmax=1, decimals=0)) # xmax=1 assumes the original data is in decimal format (e.g., 0.20)

# Optimize the layout and display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
### Results

![Most optimal Skill for Data Analysts in the US](images/Most_Optimal_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_in_the_US_with_Coloring_by_Technology.png)


### Insights
- The Python Sweet Spot üêç: Python is a top-tier skill, requested in over 27% of job postings. Crucially, it also commands the highest median salary among the most common skills, at nearly $98K.
- High Demand Doesn't Always Mean High Pay: SQL and Excel are the two most requested skills overall, appearing in 51% and 41% of job postings, respectively. However, the scatter plot shows that while both are essential, Excel's median salary $84K is significantly lower than that of more technical skills like SQL 91K and Python.
- BI Tools are Valuable: Visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI strike an excellent balance. They are frequently requested (over 20%) and are associated with solid median salaries (over $90K), making them high-value assets for an analyst.
- Niche Skills Pay Well: Specialized database skills like Oracle offer high salaries (over $96K) but appear in a much smaller percentage of job postings. This highlights a classic trade-off between learning a widely-used tool versus a high-paying, specialized one.
